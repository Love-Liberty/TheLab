    <p>Click in the input panel, type your note, click <strong>[save/send]</strong>. The note will be stored in the database.</p>

    <p>If you click on any of the little boxes, that name will be attached to the note and stored in the database. Later you will be able to search for notes with any of these <em>tags</em>.</p>

    <h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Tags – Attached to the Note</h4>
    <p>The <em>main</em> tags currently show that your note is a bug report (reporting something wrong with the system). Other main tags include <em>me</em> (a note to yourself), <em>else</em> (directed to someone else), and <em>reply</em> (a response to an existing note).</p>

    <h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Tags – Importance</h4>
    <p>At the top right is a choice to set how important you regard this note. The default is 3. If your note is less important than average, click a lower number. If more important, click a higher number. (To go to 6, you’ll have to wait until it’s implemented.)</p>

    <h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Tags – Events</h4>
    <p>This group includes <em>diary</em>, commonly used for project tracking. It implies commentary on actions taken and progress. <em>Triumph</em>, <em>disaster</em>, and <em>rant</em> are more extreme tags.</p>

    <h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Tags – Process, Business, & Resource</h4>
    <p>All tags are treated the same in the system. In future, tag names will be editable so you can define a system that suits your project or life.</p>

    <h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Tags – Pending, Abandoned, Completed</h4>
    <p>These are available after saving/sending a note. You apply them by clicking on a saved message. The status cycles through symbols: green <em>?</em> (pending), ✅ (completed), red <em>?</em> (uncertain), and ❌ (abandoned).</p>

    <h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Saved Notes</h4>
    <p>When you visit or refresh the site, saved notes appear below the <strong>[save/send]</strong> button. The most recent note is at the top. Use the <strong>[←]</strong> and <strong>[→]</strong> buttons to navigate. Clicking a note sets its <em>status</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>The Lab</strong> is a minor part of a larger project, built in pieces with the belief that any piece could have its own value.</p>

    <p>The Lab is a place to keep notes and links. Notes can be tagged and later found by searching. You can edit tags to suit your interests — whether it’s cars, wars, or anything else. The system will help prevent misspellings so you can reliably find your notes.</p>

    <p>The default tag set is aimed at software developers — because we’re the first users.</p>
