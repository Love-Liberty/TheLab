Purpose: The Lab is a browser-based sandbox for developing and organizing scripts, links, and documentation relating to Supabase and Lovable. Stage 1 targets single-user functionality with no backend storage or third-party access.
Key Features:
Static user interface layout with vertical navigation and dynamic main content areas
Placeholder interactive components (e.g., cards, buttons) with future-ready structure
Instructional resources and links to external services (GitHub, Supabase)

The web app is for development and testing of ways of using Lovable & Supabase. It is a ‘sandbox’ from which different scripts can be linked and information about the two software services. 

The eventual aim is that it is a web services which users can sign-into to have their own version of the sandbox to try out ideas, cut and paste code snippets or entire template style functions.

The web app will not actually run the scripts, but is a way to keep track of a project and to have all the relevant links in one control panel. Running the scripts and hosting is done by a platform which we do not control.

Eventually each user will get a persistent sandbox tied to a membership database and their auth credentials.

For now, development is under a single-user model managed by the platform.

There will be no 3rd party users and no backend storage in Stage 1.

It will start very simply for 1 user to develop the concept. Later it will have member management.
