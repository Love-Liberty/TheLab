<div><p>Click in the input panel, type your note, click [save/send]. The note will be stored in the database.</p>
  <p>If you click on any of the little boxes that name will be attached to the note and stored in the database. 
    Later you will be able to search for notes with any of these <i>tags</i> </p>
<h4>Tags - attached to the note</h4>
  <p>The <i>main</i> tags currently show that your note is a bug report (reporting something wrong with the system). 
    The other main tags are <i>me</i> which means it is a note to yourself, <i>else</i> which means the note is directed towards someone else, <i>reply</i> which means it should be a reply to an existing note</p>
 <h4>Tags - importance</h4>
  <p>At the top right is a choice of setting how important you regard this note. The importance is usually set at 3. 
    If your notes is less important than average click a lower number. If more important than average click a higher number. (If you really want o go to 6 you will have to wait until this is implemented)</p>
<h4>Tags - events</h4>
  <p>This group of tags includes <i>diary</i> which is a very commonly used tag if you are keeping track of a project. 
    It implies a commentary on actions taken and progress or lack of it. <i>triumph,disaster, and rant are extreme tags</i> </p>
<h4>Tags - process, business, & resource</h4>
  <p>All tags are treated the same in the system and the name will, in future be editable so that you can define the tagging system that is good for your project or life </p>
<h4>Tags - Pending, abandoned, completed</h4>
<p>These are available after saving/sending the note. These can be applied after reading a note. 
  To apply these tags is different because you are marking the message after considering it. To do this you need to find the saved messages by scrolling down. 
  Then click on a message to show a pending symbol, which is a question mark.If you repeat the click the various possible symbols will cycle. 
Click once for green <i>?</i> again for a completed tick symbol, again returns to a red <i>?</i> and again brings a red x representing abandoning/ignoring the note</p>
<h4>Saved Notes</h4>
  <p>When you first visit the site or you refresh the browser page, the saved notes are displayed on the notes page below the [save/send] button. 
  The display is most recent note at the top. To see older notes click the [<-] & [->] buttons on the bottom of the notes display. Clicking on a note sets its <i><status/i> </p>

              <p>The Lab is a minor part of a larger project, but the whole project is built in pieces in the belief that any piece could turn out to have its own value
              <p> The lab is a place to keep your notes and also keep links to websites. The notes can be tagged and later found by searching for notes with specific tags. 
                  The Lab begins with a default set of tags, but you can edit them to suit your interests or projects. If you are collecting info about cars you may want tags that
                are specific to cars and you may want web links to car parts dealers or car showrooms or photos of cars. If you are writing about a war you
                may want to store quotes and have tags specifying certain periods or places. You can edit your own tag list. And once the system knows it will prevent you mispelling them.
                In that way you will be able to find the note because tags are standardised. </p>
                <p>The default setting for the Lab is aimed at software developers. Why? Because we are the 
                first users of the product and so that is how we have edited it.   </p>

<p>August 10th at 20:25 in the year 2025 we took status to 8. This is because for the first time our little note book app became able to mark notes with a status.
</p>
                <p>This may mean little to you, but a lot to us</p>
              
              <p>Nothing in computer programming is easy. Every little thing that is done can cause hours of puzzlement as arcane error codes dribble into the console.
              </p>
                <p>But you aren't here to read the moans of an ai assisted software developer. So what is this Lab thing all about?</p>

                  <p>The Lab has two main components:</p>

                  <li><strong>Frontend</strong> - The user interface you're looking at right now</li>
                  <li><strong>Backend</strong> - The Supabase database that stores your data</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Both need to be connected to your account at Lovable</strong> <a href="https://lovable.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">[Learn how]</a></p>
                <p>In addition you need to know where to put pages and how to get them recognised by Lovable. If you put them in the wrong places‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt.</p>
                <p>Here are some initial instructions‚Ä¶</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">How to include a new webpage:</h4>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Adding a new script:</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                  <li>Scripts should be placed in the /scripts or /src/utils folder</li>
                  <li>Ensure your script follows the required format (JavaScript/TypeScript)</li>
                  <li>Reference your script in the appropriate HTML or component file</li>
