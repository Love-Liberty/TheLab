                <span class="ml-2 text-sm text-gray-500">They said it was easy</span>
<p>August 10th at 20:25 in the year 2025 we took status to 8. This is because for the first time our little note book app became able to mark notes with a status.
</p>
                <p>This may mean little to you, but a lot to us</p>
              
              <p>Nothing in computer programming is easy. Every little thing that is done can cause hours of puzzlement as arcane error codes dribble into the console.
              </p>
                <p>But you aren't here to read the moans of an ai assisted software developer. So what is this Lab thing all about?</p>

              <p>The Lab is a minor part of a larger project, but the whole project is built in pieces in the belief that any piece could turn out to have its own value
              <p> The lab is a place to keep your notes and also keep links to websites. The notes can be tagged and later found by searching for notes with specific tags. 
                  The Lab begins with a default set of tags, but you can edit them to suit your interests or projects. If you are collecting info about cars you may want tags that
                are specific to cars and you may want web links to car parts dealers or car showrooms or photos of cars. If you are writing about a war you
                may want to store quotes and have tags specifying certain periods or places. You can edit your own tag list. And once the system knows it will prevent you mispelling them.
                In that way you will be able to find the note because tags are standardised. </p>
                <p>The default setting for the Lab is aimed at software developers. Why? Because we are the 
                first users of the product and so that is how we have edited it.   </p>

                  <p>The Lab has two main components:</p>

                  <li><strong>Frontend</strong> - The user interface you're looking at right now</li>
                  <li><strong>Backend</strong> - The Supabase database that stores your data</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Both need to be connected to your account at Lovable</strong> <a href="https://lovable.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">[Learn how]</a></p>
                <p>In addition you need to know where to put pages and how to get them recognised by Lovable. If you put them in the wrong places‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt.</p>
                <p>Here are some initial instructions‚Ä¶</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">How to include a new webpage:</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Adding a new script:</h4>
